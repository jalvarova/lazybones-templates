Lazybones template project
--------------------------

You have just created a simple project for managing your own Lazybones project
templates. You get a build file (`build.gradle`) and a directory for putting
your templates in (`templates`).

To get started, simply create new directories under the `templates` directory
and put the source of the different project templates into them. You can then
package and install the templates locally with the command:

    ./gradlew installAllTemplates

You'll then be able to use Lazybones to create new projects from these templates.
If you then want to distribute them, you will need to set up a Bintray account,
populate the `repositoryUrl`, `repositoryUsername` and `repositoryApiKey` settings
in `build.gradle`, add new Bintray packages in the repository via the Bintray
UI, and finally publish the templates with

    ./gradlew publishAllTemplates



You can find out more about creating templates on [the GitHub wiki][1].

== Templates Available

microservicio-arquetipo:: Jumpstart template for a Microservice project with Spring Boot.


== Usage

To actually use the template you need to have lazybones installed. The easiest way to get it is via  http://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN].
So first, let's install that:

----
$ curl -s http://get.sdkman.io | bash
----

(Windows users: look for the https://github.com/flofreud/posh-gvm[Powershell version])

Then, we can use it to install gradle and lazybones:

----
$ sdk install lazybones
$ sdk install gradle
----

Next register the lazybones-templates repository with Lazybones' config file. Edit `$USER_HOME/.lazybones/config.groovy`

----
bintrayRepositories = [
    "joedayz/lazybones-templates",
    "pledbrook/lazybones-templates"
]
----

If everything is fine, issuing the command

----
$ lazybones list
----

should list the Intercorp Retail template:

----
Available templates in joedayz/lazybones-templates

    microservicio-arquetipo
----

Now, we can use it to create a new Dolphin Platform project:

----
$ lazybones create microservicio-arquetipo MyProject
----

To get an idea on how to proceed from here, have a look at the https://github.com/joedayz/lazybones-templates/blob/master/templates/microservicio-arquetipo/README.adoc[template README] of the generated project.
