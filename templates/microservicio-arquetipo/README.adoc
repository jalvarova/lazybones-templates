# Microservicio Arquetipo


This automatically created project can be used as a basic skeleton for a Micro Service:

- Domain
- Config
- Util
- Service
- Repository
- Controller
- Constant

## How to use it

The project is created with a maven build. You can directly import it in any IDE that supports maven (like Eclipse or IntelliJ).
If you want to start the application you need to start the ProyectoApplication.java.

If you want to start the application from commandline without IDE support you can use the following commands:

Run the server from the microservicio-arquetipo folder
```
cd microservicio-arquetipo
mvn spring-boot:run
```
